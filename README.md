# Max-Subarray-Sum-and-Length---Kadane-Algorithm
This Python script implements an enhanced version of **Kadane’s Algorithm** to find the **maximum sum** of a contiguous subarray and the **length** of that subarray. It’s a classic problem in dynamic programming and greedy algorithms, often asked in coding interviews and used in real-world applications like signal processing and financial analysis.
